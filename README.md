# C Programming Projects  

This repository contains various C programs covering different programming concepts like number operations, text processing, sorting algorithms, and more. Some are practical, while others are just for fun. Explore the code and see what each one does!  

## Getting Started  

To run any program:  

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/onelrian/c-fundamentals.git
   cd c-fundamentals
   ```  
2. **Compile a program:**  
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
   ```  
3. **Follow the prompts** and see the output!
